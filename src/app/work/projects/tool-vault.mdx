## Overview

In this project, I implemented a CLI tool that allows users to easily back up their codebase, which can be used later for rollback or as a boilerplate for new projects.

## Key Features

- #### vault save

Saves the codebase from the specified source path, with the given name.

The codebases are stored in a directory named _Vault Storage_ under the user's home directory.

The directory is created if it does not exist already.

Usage:
```bash
vault save <source_path> <name>
```

Example:
```bash
vault save /path/to/codebase my_project
```

- #### vault load

Loads and pastes the specified codebase from the _Vault Storage_ to the specified destination.

Usage:
```bash
vault load <destination_path> <name>
```

Example:
```bash
vault load /path/to/paste my_project
```

- #### vault list

Lists all the codebases saved in the _Vault Storage_.

Usage:
```bash
vault list
```

- #### vault delete

Deletes the specified codebase from the _Vault Storage_.

Usage:
```bash
vault delete <name>
```

Example:
```bash
vault delete my_project
```

- #### vault help

Displays help information for the CLI tool.

Usage:
```bash
vault --help
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python and its libraries**: For coding the Vault CLI functionality.
- **Linux-based machine**: For testing its working.
- **ChatGPT**: As my coding companion.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge with this project was keeping it simple. I added more and more features instead of keeping it simple and some parts of it always kept breaking. Had to somewhat start over to achieve the simplicity I wanted. I also learned a lot about how to use Python and its libraries to create a CLI tool.

## Outcome

A simple CLI tool to save, load, list, and delete codebases from the vault storage.

It is a great tool for developers who want to locally save their codebases for later.
