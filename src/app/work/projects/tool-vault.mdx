## Overview

**Vault** is a lightweight, local-first command line tool for developers who frequently work with similar project setups. Instead of rewriting the same boilerplate, reinstalling the same dependencies, or copying over reused components, Vault allows you to save your codebase structure once and load it into any new project directory instantly.

Vault is intentionally simple. Just clean copies of your codebase you can trust; stored locally and instantly restorable.

Why spend time rebuilding what you’ve already built?

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine.
- A Linux-based operating system (tested on MacOS).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/adnanxsalim/tool-vault.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
      cd tool-vault
  ```
3. Update the `vault` script to make it executable:
  ```bash
      chmod +x vault.py
  ```
4. Move the `vault` script to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
  ```bash
      sudo mv vault.py /usr/local/bin/vault
  ```

## Key Features

#### vault save

Saves the codebase from the specified source path, with the given name.

The codebases are stored in a directory named _Vault Storage_ under the user's home directory.

The directory is created if it does not exist already.

Usage:
`vault save <source_path> <name>`

Example:
`vault save /path/to/codebase my_project`

#### vault load

Loads and pastes the specified codebase from the _Vault Storage_ to the specified destination.

Usage:
`vault load <destination_path> <name>`

Example:
`vault load /path/to/paste my_project`

#### vault list

Lists all the codebases saved in the _Vault Storage_.

Usage:
`vault list`

#### vault delete

Deletes the specified codebase from the _Vault Storage_.

Usage:
`vault delete <name>`

Example:
`vault delete my_project`

#### vault help

Displays help information for the CLI tool.

Usage:
`vault --help`

## Technologies Used

- **Python and its libraries**: For coding the Vault CLI functionality.
- **Linux-based machine**: For testing its working.
- **ChatGPT**: As my coding companion.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge with this project was keeping it simple. I added more and more features instead of keeping it simple and some parts of it always kept breaking. Had to somewhat start over to achieve the simplicity I wanted. I also learned a lot about how to use Python and its libraries to create a CLI tool.

## Outcome

With Vault in my toolbox, I:

- Reduced project setup time by at least 10 minutes per project
- Eliminated repetitive configuration and dependency management
- Created a simple and repeatable workflow for bootstrapping projects
- Had peace of mind knowing my base setups are always one command away

Vault isn't trying to be a full-fledged version control system or a cloud backup service.

It’s a minimal safety net, just enough for developers who want speed and sanity.
