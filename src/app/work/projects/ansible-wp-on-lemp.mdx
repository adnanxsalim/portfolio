## Overview

In this project, I created an Ansible playbook from scratch to install and configure WordPress on LEMP(Linux, Nginx, MySQL & PHP) stack.

## Key Features

- **CMS and blog**: Executed with the help of WordPress.
- **Secure MySQL database**: With the help of phpMyAdmin and mysql_secure_installation.
- **Robust & secure web server**: With the help of the Nginx web server and Certbot for SSL certficate allocation.
- **User directory web hosting**: Set up SELinux and Firewall to allow web hosting under user's home directory.
- **Domain name**: Mapped a domain name to the deployment by adding an "A record" at the DNS settings provided by the domain registrar.

## Technologies Used

- **Ansible**: For automating the process (as an IaC).
- **AWS**: For creating an EC2 instance with an Elastic IP attached to it.
- **WordPress**: As the Content Management System (CMS) and blog platform.
- **MySQL**: For the database.
- **Nginx**: As the web server.
- **SFTP**: For others (say, a developer) to access/edit the contents via the secure SFTP port.
- **phpMyAdmin**: As additional security and as a GUI for the MySQL database, accessible via domain_name/phpmyadmin endpoint.
- **Certbot**: For generating the SSL certificate to bypass HTTP traffic that is not secure, to HTTPS.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge with this project was the debugging process, which took forever. But one-by-one, the errors were rectified to ensure the smooth running of the Ansible playbook.

## Outcome

A secure web hosting infrastructure, implementing a full LEMP stack with enhanced security features and WordPress integration. Successfully configured six critical system components across web server, database, and content management layers using Ansible, as a control node.
