**Every career is a journey—an evolving narrative shaped by challenges, breakthroughs, and those defining moments that shift the trajectory. Today, I’m opening up about mine. Not as a retrospective, but as a waypoint—between where I started and where I’m headed.**

You may have come across my skill stack in the about section and wondered, _“How did all this come together?”_ Or more honestly, _“Is any of this even real?”_ Fair questions. Let me take you back to the beginning—where it all started, and why none of it was ever part of a master plan.

## The Bench, the Thought, the Spark

It started during higher secondary. I was just a kid on a bench, wrestling with a simple thought: _How do I support my family financially?_

At the time, the internet was buzzing with big promises. YouTube gurus shouted into their mics about the _“next big thing”_ and like everyone else, I tuned in—curious, hopeful, maybe even a little naïve.

**Trading** was the first rabbit hole. I devoured tutorials, obsessed over candlesticks, and started charting strategies—until the reality check hit: _You need to be 18 to trade_. That dream was benched before it could take its first step.

Next came **dropshipping and blogging**. I spun up stores on Shopify, and hacked my way through WordPress themes—and stumbled my way through web hosting and DNS configurations, skills that didn’t seem like much at the time, but turned out to be incredibly valuable later during my training and internship at **ipsr**. The biggest hurdle back then? Costs that I couldn’t cover. I learned a lot. Failed fast. Kept moving.

## Pandemic, Disruption, and a Strategic Pivot

By the tail-end of 12th grade, just as I was applying for colleges, COVID struck. The world paused—and so did I.

In the chaos, I found direction.

I stumbled onto a **Digital Marketing course by LinkedIn Learning**. “Let me secure my admission first,” I told myself. Then I hit _start_. By October 2020, I was certified as a **Digital Marketing Specialist**.

But here’s the second realization: Marketing doesn’t exist in isolation. You need copy. You need design.

So, I dove into **Graphic Design**, again through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube. Figma became my canvas. Every pixel taught me something new.

## Coding, Crypto & Curiosity

During my first two years of college, I pivoted again—this time to **code**. Got certified in **Responsive Web Design** from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org). Learned the basics: HTML, CSS, a sprinkle of JS.

Meanwhile, the 2021 **crypto bull run** was peaking. I invested. I won. I lost. Hard.

But beyond the charts and chaos, something deeper clicked: **blockchain**. I wasn’t just fascinated by the coins—I was captivated by the tech. I started digging in, reading, experimenting, building.

## From Projects to Purpose
In my final college years, I began turning tutorials into **real-world projects**. Some of them fed directly into my academic work. Others were passion-fueled builds that helped me sharpen my dev skills and think more like a creator.

Post-graduation, I joined **ipsr solutions ltd**, where I trained in **Cloud & DevOps** and completed an internship in the same domain. It grounded me in infrastructure, systems, and scalability—adding a whole new dimension to my skill set.

## The Road Ahead

I’m proud of the path I’ve walked. Not because it was linear or perfect—but because it was real. Every misstep taught me something. Every pivot shaped who I am today.

And one thing hasn’t changed: **I’m still sharpening my skills every chance I get**. From design to development, from marketing to cloud—I’m obsessed with growth. Learning is no longer a phase; it’s a habit.

But here’s the thing: _This isn’t a destination. It’s a checkpoint._

The road ahead is brimming with possibilities, and I’m more energized than ever to explore them—through relentless learning, bold execution, and projects that leave an impact.

If there’s one truth I carry with me, it’s this:

**Every milestone is a spark—not a full stop. And every spark is just fuel for the next chapter.**

Thanks for being part of this journey. The best is yet to come.
